Introduction to PHP
What is PHP 
PHP(PHP: Hypertext Processer) is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.
To understand PHP's role let's first understand how websites work:

1: When you visit a website , your browser(the client) sends a request to a web server
2: The server processes this request
3: For static websites, the simply returns HTML files
4. For dynamic websites using PHP, the server:
    -Executes the PHP code 
    -Generates HTML based on codes output 
    -Sends the HTML back to the browser 

Think of it like ordering at a restaurant
-You the (browser) make an order(request)
-The chef (PHP) prepares the meal(process the code)
-The waiter (server) brings you the finished meal(HTML)

Settinh up your development enviroment
